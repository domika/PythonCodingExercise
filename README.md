# Python Coding Exercise

## String Calculator
 
Using Python with a Test Driven approach, create a simple String Calculator which covers the following requirements:
 
1. Adds numbers present in the input, e.g "1,2" = 3, "10,4" = 14
2. Treats empty or null input as zero, e.g "" = 0, null = 0
3. Supports different delimiters, e.g "1,2,3", "1 2 3"
4. Does not support negative numbers
5. Ignores numbers greater than 100
